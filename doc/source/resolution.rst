Initial thoughts
================

From the previous task, it is clear that the main target of the tournament is
selecting which is the MVP. Also, players are allowed to participate in different
teams and different matches in fact, meaning that teams and matches are not good
elections for unique identifiers. Players must be the unique identifiers of the
software code implemented.

Since the language of choice is Python, and there is no need to implement databases
(i.e. simple processing script) the most ideal solution might be the usage of a
dictionary in which the keys are the player's nicknames (i.e. unique identifiers).
